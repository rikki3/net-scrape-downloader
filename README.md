# net-scrape-downloader
C# test project:
An internet download manager with capabilities to fetch direct links to specified content given the correct domain and xpath is setup.
Accurate recreation of parts of the codebase has been tested and is now easily accessible with the use of LLMs.
This means the project is no longer entirely abandoned pending system & environment limitations.
